# RaumMotor

RaumMotor is a 3D game engine in development. It will use Vulkan as its main rendering API and is written in C++-20 and is intended for use on Linux and Windows.

It is mainly intended to be the next iteration of the [T3Vtech-3 game engine](https://github.com/tevoran/T3Vtech-3). Many of the design flaws of it will be overhauled. If you are interested in more details feel free to check out the design documents [here](doc/).

The engine itself is still in a very early design phase so please check out the progress on the project at a later point in time again.
